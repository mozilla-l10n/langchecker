langchecker
===========

Code to replicate the langchecker feature on my webdashboard

To set it up, rename the file:

config/settings.inc.php.ini

as:

config/settings.inc.php

And indicate in this file the local paths to the various svn repositories the application tracks.

Then install dependencies (composer install)
